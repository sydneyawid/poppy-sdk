## Abstract
The Poppy Social Robotics Project utilizes the foundation of the [Poppy Project](https://poppy-project.org/en/) to construct a robot with social capabilities akin to basic human interaction. The end goal for the bot is to facilitate social interactions with children on the autism spectrum (ASD). The robot will perform tasks that replicate interpersonal communication using facial and speech recognition. The robot's head redesign houses the essential, sensory hardware and LCD. Therefore, the robot has a simple, friendly face that will emote on the LCD, and speak according to detected emotions using text-matching and randomized response. Additionally, the software will activate the servos posing as joints in the body and neck, to make social normative gestures with the face's response to user stimulus.

## Voice Recognition and Response
`` Insert just the way to call the entire class to make it work
Breif explanation on how it works and what it returns``

## Facial Recognition and Tracking
```python
	face_tracking = poppy_tracking(capture, model_path)
	face_tracking.main_window()
```

`` Show how to call facial recognition and tracking
Breif explanation on how it works and what it returns``

## Emotional Recognition
`` Insert how to call the emotional recognition class
Breif explanation on how it works and what it returns``

## Eye Tracking
`` Insert how to call the eye tracking class
Breif explanation on how it works and what it returns``

## Facial Emotion Display
`` Insert how to call the facial emotion display
Breif explanation on how it works and what it returns``

## Head and Body Gestures
`` Insert an example of a head and body gesture
Breif explanation on how it works and what it returns``

## Synced Example Code
`` Just put the main loop here
Breif explanation on how it works``
